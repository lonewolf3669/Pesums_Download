  Welcome to Pesums (the “Platform”),<br> provided by the Pesums Team (“we” or “us”).<br>
  You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”),<br> which govern the relationship and serve
  as an agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you
  may access and use the Platform and our related websites,<br> services,<br> applications,<br> products
  and content (collectively,<br> the “Services”).<br> Your access to certain Services or features of the
  Services may be subject to age restrictions and not available to all users of the Services.<br>
  Your use of certain Services or features of the Services may be subject to service-specific
  additional terms and policies.<br> For purposes of these Terms,<br> “you” and “your” mean you as
  the user of the Services.<br>
  Unless you accept the Terms,<br> you have no right or authorization to use any part of the
  Services which requires you to be a Registered User.<br>
  By accessing our Services or using our
  Services,<br> you confirm that you can form a binding contract with us,<br> that you accept these
  Terms and that you agree to comply with them.<br> You understand and agree that we will treat
  your access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.<br> Your
  access to and use of our Services are also subject to our Privacy Policy,<br> which is
  incorporated herein by reference.<br>
  <h3>By accessing the Services,<br> you agree and represent to us:</h3>
  <h3> i) that you are at least 12 years of age,<br> or the statutory age of majority in your state of
    nationality and residence,<br> whichever is higher;</h3>
  <h3>ii) that you are not restricted from using the Services,<br> by law,<br> by contract,<br> or by us;

    and agreed to be responsible for any of your liability arising hereof.<br></h3>
  Your fundamental rights as a Registered User to the Services are mainly set forth in the

  of dispute resolution on an individual basis.<br> The venue of such disputes may not be in the
  country where you reside.<br>
  <h3> Special note: We are only a tool app and we do not provide any contents to you,<br> nor
    are we involved in or responsible for your personal behaviors while using the Service.<br>
    As a user,<br> you confirm and represent to us that you fully understand the laws and
    regulations of your country or region before using or accepting the Service,<br> and your

  will be effective at the time we first post it onto our Platform (or at any other time
  designated in the terms of such version,<br> if any).<br> We will use commercially reasonable
  efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms,<br> such as through
  a notice on our Platform.<br> However,<br> you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such
  changes.<br> We will also put the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms,<br> which reflects the
  effective date of such Terms.<br> Your continued use of the Services thereafter will constitute
  your acceptance of,<br> and consent to,<br> such modifications or revisions.<br> If you object to any
